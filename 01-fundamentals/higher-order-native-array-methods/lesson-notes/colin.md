# Higher Order Native Array Methods

These lesson notes cover `.every()`, `.some()`, and `.sort()`.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson you should be able to:

- Describe the input and return values of `.every()`.
- Use `.every()` to solve code problems.
- Describe the input and return values of `.some()`.
- Use `.some()` to solve code problems.
- Describe the input and return values of `.sort()`.
- Use `.sort()` to solve code problems.

## Guiding Questions

- What is a higher order function?

- What is a native array method?

- What does it mean for a function to produce side effects?

- What does it mean for a function to return a value?

- Is it possible for functions that return values to also produce side effects?

- The `.every()` method expects at least one argument. What data type is this argument?

- What is a callback function?

- The `.every()` method's callback function has up to three parameters. What are these parameters?

- Take a look at the following code, which is incomplete. Based on how the code _reads,_ what do you expect the `.every()` method to do?

  ```js
  const comics = [
    { title: "Calvin & Hobbes", author: "Bill Watterson", kind: "print" },
    { title: "Zen Pencils", author: "Gavin Aung Than", kind: "web" },
    { title: "Nancy", author: "Olivia James", kind: "print" },
    { title: "False Knees", author: "Joshua Barkman", kind: "web" },
  ];

  const result = comics.every(isPrintComic);
  console.log(result); //> false
  ```

- Update the code below so that it uses the `.every()` method instead of a `for` loop. Inside of `allComicsHaveTitles()` you will have to write another, anonymous function.

  ```js
  function allComicsHaveTitles(comics) {
    let result = true;
    for (let comic of comics) {
      if (!comic.title) result = false;
    }
    return result;
  }

  const result = allComicsHaveTitles(comics);
  console.log(result); //> false
  ```

- The callback function inside of the `.every()` method coerces the returned value into a boolean. What does the previous sentence mean? Describe in your own words.

- How does the `.some()` method differ from the `.every()` method? How is it similar?

- Take a look at the following code. How many times does the `isWebComic()` function get called? How could you confirm?

  ```js
  function isWebComic(comic) {
    return comic.kind === "web";
  }

  const result = comics.some(isWebComic);
  console.log(result); //> true
  ```

- The `.sort()` method sorts elements in an array. Although the functionality is very different, in what ways is it similar to `.every()` and `.some()`?

- Calling the `.sort()` method looks like it might magically work, depending on the elements in the array it is sorting.

  ```js
  const numbers = [4, 2, 3, 1, 0];
  const result = numbers.sort();
  console.log(result); //> [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
  ```

  However, it can have unexpected results.

  ```js
  const numbers = [11, 1, 0, 22, 2];
  const result = numbers.sort();
  console.log(result); //> [ 0, 1, 11, 2, 22 ]
  ```

  In general, you should not use the `.sort()` method without a callback function. However, can you describe why the `.sort()` method is organizing the numbers above in this way?

- The `.sort()` method expects one argument. What data type is this argument?

- The `.sort()` method's callback function has up to two parameters. What are these parameters?

- The `.sort()` method's callback function expects a number to be returned. The number must either be a positive number, a negative number, or `0`. What is the effect of each of these values?

- The code below sorts numbers appropriately. Based on what you know about `.sort()` will the numbers be sorted in ascending order (i.e. 0, 1, 2...) or descending order (i.e. 22, 11, 2...)?

  ```js
  const numbers = [11, 1, 0, 22, 2];
  const result = numbers.sort((a, b) => {
    if (a > b) {
      return -1;
    }

    if (a < b) {
      return 1;
    }

    return 0;
  });
  console.log(result);
  ```

- Is `.sort()` a destructive or non-destructive method?

- Take a look at the table below. What does each column mean?

  | Method     | Callback expected return value | Method return value | Destructive? |
  | ---------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------ |
  | `.every()` | Boolean.                       | Boolean.            | No.          |
  | `.some()`  | Boolean.                       | Boolean.            | No.          |
  | `.sort()`  | Number.                        | An array.           | Yes.         |
